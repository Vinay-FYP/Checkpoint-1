geting to grips with firebase 


Here I began looking into Firebase on Youtube and reverting to my class noes also. I was having some issues registering users and then logging them in correctly.
I crawled through youtube following many tutorials util i finally solved one and by replicating it successfully and being able to register users and then login and redirect back to a homescreen.

I also began to practise with UI tutorials in order to begin laying out my project. I looked into some wireframing but mostly followed UI tutorials on youtube as well as the basics of android programming and learning some of the commands neccessary in order to do the most basic functions.

I then due to illness spent most of my time researching and looking into cabon emissions, calculators and the maths involved to calculate the values I needed in my application. 
I struggled a lot finding concrete maths to base my project off as there was so many differetn methods invovled in calculating emissions, mostly using formulas involving variales I did not know how to caclulate or implement in my calculator. This part of researching wa where I learned the most i think in this chekpoint. I luckily contacted an engineer who pointed me in the direction of a a few websites and then contacted some notional agencies and requested usage statisitics and infomation on carbon emmissions. I recieved some replies but mostly ignored but it was enough to get me going. I was increasingly roadblocked in finding an emissions factor to use in my calculations for each variable involved in caclulating a users footprint. Emissions or changed for each ariable and varied between differetn calculators all basing their fomulas of varied gasses not just carbon. I settled on a formulas and decided to move onto the building phase of the project and revisit the formulas at a later stage.
